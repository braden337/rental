I am very satisfied, that I was able to learn how to do this.
Things kind of clicked for me after I watched some Harvard CS75
lectures on YouTube. They demonstrated with PHP and talked about sessions
and authentication. I started reading about the PHP `password_hash()`
function and how you use `password_verify(string $password, string $hash)`
to check a user-submitted password against a hashed password in your database.

Very interesting stuff. I love learning about web development and security.
I love adding new features and the feeling when everything works, but also
the feeling when you encounter a problem and you have to really think about the
solution.
